<h3> Friday Thoughts</h3>
<p> 
    <br>
    Its never clear how I feel about Fridays.
     Because on the one hand at least it's the weekend,
      but on the other hand its almost always the day with
     the most amount of requirements due. I personally think 
     the idea of rest is enough to get me through all the work
    we need to do but even more than that the friends I have
     that go through all this with me.
<br><br>
 Some of the subjects on this day are pretty tough. I really
     struggle in Math and Computer science because I didn't have
      any of the grade 7 & 8 lessons, but do I try, and even if I
    fail over and over I will try again. The teachers and classmates
     I have everyday also make this day more bearable so its still
      okay. If there isn't anything to do though just listening to
       the teachers will always be a good day because I still learn 
       something new and they make it easier with how kind and open 
       they are to those who ask questions.
<br><br>
 Overall, Fridays are the intro to the weekend and when done right
     play with your favorite music. Just dont overstress, relax and have fun
     so you can be ready for next week!
